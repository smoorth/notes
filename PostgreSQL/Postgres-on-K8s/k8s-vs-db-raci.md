## RACI Definitions

- **R** (Responsible): The team that performs the task.
- **A** (Accountable): The team ultimately answerable for the task's completion.
- **C** (Consulted): The team that provides input or expertise.
- **I** (Informed): The team that is kept up to date on progress and outcomes.

This model ensures a clear division of responsibilities, balancing Kubernetes infrastructure management with database-specific tasks while ensuring collaboration between both teams.
