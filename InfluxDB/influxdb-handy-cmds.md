## InfluxDB Basics

### What is InfluxDB?

- InfluxDB is an **open-source time series database** designed to handle high write and query loads.
- It's optimized for **storing and analyzing time-stamped data** like metrics, events, and analytics.
- InfluxDB uses a **SQL-like query language called InfluxQL** and a newer language called **Flux**.
- It is part of the **TICK stack** (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor) for complete monitoring solutions.

### Key Concepts Simplified

- **Database**: In InfluxDB 1.x, a container for time series data, users, retention policies, and continuous queries. In InfluxDB 2.x, replaced by "bucket".
- **Bucket**: In InfluxDB 2.x, a named location where time series data is stored with a retention period.
- **Measurement**: Similar to a table in relational databases, a container for tags, fields, and timestamps.
- **Tag**: Key-value pairs storing metadata. Tags are indexed, making them efficient for queries.
- **Field**: Key-value pairs storing the actual data. Fields are not indexed.
- **Point**: A single data record with a measurement, tag set, field set, and timestamp.
- **Series**: A collection of data sharing a measurement, tag set, and retention policy.
- **Retention Policy**: Rules for how long InfluxDB keeps data and how many copies to store.

### How InfluxDB Works

- Data is organized into **points with timestamps**, making time-based queries very efficient.
- **Tags are indexed** for fast filtering, while **fields are not indexed** but store the actual values.
- InfluxDB uses a **Time-Structured Merge Tree** (TSM) storage engine optimized for time series data.
- **Continuous queries** automatically compute aggregates in the background.
- **Retention policies** automatically expire and delete old data.

### Tips for Beginners

- Use the `influx` CLI tool for interactive access to InfluxDB.
- Choose tags carefullyâ€”they are indexed and good for filtering, but too many unique tags can cause high memory usage.
- Use fields for data you need to store but don't often filter by.
- Leverage retention policies to automatically manage data lifecycle.
- Structure measurement names logically (e.g., `system_cpu`, `system_memory`).

### Common Issues to Watch For

- **High cardinality**: Too many unique tag combinations can degrade performance.
- **Write throughput**: Monitor write performance, especially on resource-constrained systems.
- **Query complexity**: Complex queries across large time ranges can be resource-intensive.
- **Disk space**: Time series data can grow rapidly; set appropriate retention policies.
- **Memory usage**: InfluxDB loads metadata into memory; large tag sets require more RAM.
